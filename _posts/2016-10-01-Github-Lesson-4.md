    <td>This lesson I learned how to change the colour of my font to make my blog look classier. I focused well and achieved the task by not having to ask any of my peers, and I still don't have to face the daunting prospect of asking my teacher. Moreover, I used Github’s advice when I made mistakes much more usefully, and not ignoring it because it looked like a complicated lump of gibberish.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For the first time, I don’t think I got distracted by an irrelevant topic! This is mainly because I completed the task at home and didn’t start doing something else. However I do think I took some rather silly attempts at trying to solve my problems, which to be honest is a thing people our age get too accustomed to. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will take a more logical approach to solving problems, using my computing knowledge to my advantage and I’ll probably extend myself a bit more too, since just changing the colour of my font wasn’t very advanced.</td>
