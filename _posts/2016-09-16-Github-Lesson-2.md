    <td>My teacher told our class how to change numerous aspects of our blog and make it look more classy and helped us customise our blog. I listened to the teacher but struggled to execute all of the strategies - mainly changing the colour of my background. However, I got some help from one of my fellow students and conquered the task.</td>
