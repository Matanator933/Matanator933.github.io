    <td>I spent an agonising hour on my own trying to figure out the vlookup equation without success. I then asked my dad for help, who was also intrigued about how it worked yet had similar Spreadsheet skills to his son. We ended up facetiming my uncle in America and together we managed to complete the task, with a vast sense of relief and satisfaction.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Unfortunately I've become quite accustom to getting frustrated at my work and this task was no exception. I should’ve asked for help sooner and trusted my family’s intelligence a little more, which is a lesson well learnt. I am quite proud of how I conquered this task and even potentially say that I’m looking forward to my next IT lessons and learning something new.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will ask for help sooner, no matter who it is - they might actually be some use! In addition I will try to prevent myself from getting frustrated, despite it being one of my natural reactions, and also try to think more outside the box when I get stuck in order to complete the task quicker.</td>
