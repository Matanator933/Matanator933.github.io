    <td>For the vast majority of the lesson I listened to Mr Keen explain the marking scheme of marking our blogs and watched him pick on some of my classmates and assess their work, thoroughly and correctly with little mercy. We observed blogs, from being "super good blogs" that lacked quite a bit of effort, to a blog that received a nine that I could probably only dream of making. This helped me discover what mark I would receive if I handed in my work now, which would probably be a 4 - equivalent to a D. This lesson was a big wake-up call and my listening and reflection skills were used effectively.</td>

    <td>In order to improve my blog, I've decided that I’m going to completely change my colour scheme, since it looks anything but pleasing. I will also change the font of my characters so it looks better, since my current one looks rather dull and I think the font in my work is very important. Finally I will add a background shadow behind my text since it will make my blog look more professional and make it look more dynamic.I hope that my problem solving will be effective and I won’t get stressed when what I’m trying to achieve goes wrong.</td>

    <td>I will persevere a lot more when things go wrong and not get stressed when I’m trying to achieve certain tasks. I will work at a fast pace and prevent myself from being distracted by others. If I complete my targets in the lesson with time still remaining I will find something else to do to improve my blog and make sure that I don’t relax and take my foot off the pedal.</td>
