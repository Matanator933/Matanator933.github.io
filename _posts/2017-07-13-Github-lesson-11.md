    <td>Over the last few weeks I was given the task to program a "buzzfeed-like" personality quiz on repl.it using python. I decided to base it on “What South African celebrity are you most like” in honour of my South African heritage, but that's not really relevant to what I’m supposed to be talking about. I spent a few lessons copying my information into the code and tried a basic method, and was quite unsure from then on what to do. I tried to get some inspiration from the more advanced coders in my class and using google worked out how to form a score, and from there gave a certain amount of points per answer. The correct answer was given for 2 out of the 4 celebrities but before i could fix the other two I ran out of time since I didn’t know how to solve it.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I should’ve put more effort into getting my classmates into helping me solve the problem, and also should’ve persevered more with the internet in trying to find out where I had gone wrong per error. I maybe should’ve asked my teacher or someone else in IT to help me.</td>

    <td>Next time I will definitely be more confident in asking my peers or teachers to help me extend my computing knowledge to help me achieve bigger and better things, even though there won’t be a next time :)  </td>
