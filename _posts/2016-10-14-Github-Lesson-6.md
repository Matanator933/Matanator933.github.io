    <td>I listened very well and made sure I noted down any important information I needed to know for the future. I can certainly say that I thoroughly understand all the information we need to know about Spreadsheets. I took Mr Keen's opinions of the bad schooling habits that have recently developed in society, which were that most teachers give students too much information when teaching a certain concept, so we don’t get the most out of it, whereas the best way to learn something is to work it out for yourself into account. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I didn’t concentrate as much as I should’ve when my teacher began his 'rant’ about bad schooling habits since, if I’m honest, I didn’t really think I’d believe. However, what I did listen to I mostly agreed with, although I think it is quite tricky for some teachers to get students to work out problems in certain subjects (languages, maths, etc.). I am very satisfied with my work on Spreadsheets and don’t think I could’ve done much to improve.</td>

    <td>I will value other people’s opinions more, especially my teachers since they do actually know more than I think they do. However I don’t think I could do much different next time apart from listen to people’s opinions more.</td>
