    <td>I tried entering my IT lesson with more enthusiasm and endeavoured to absorb more of Mr Keen's teaching points, which I feel I achieved better than last lesson. I completed the classwork and homework in a very effective manner, and solved the tasks with good logical, computational thinking, and observed some of my other successful coding phrases and used some inspiration from it to solve my problems when they occurred.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I tried pushing myself a little bit more in the homework, after I found the first two tasks very easy and I attempted to complete the complete version of the final question. It was only then did I come to a grinding halt for a few minutes, but just couldn’t locate where I had made my mistake. I decided to complete the question using a more basic, longer method which was successful, although I would’ve liked to completed it by using the most efficient code.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will attempt to persevere more and try to complete my work in the best way possible, instead of just going for the easy option. I will try to achieve this by using the internet for more resources and to help teach me effective lessons, and I will also ask a few of my peers for some inspiration, but make sure that they don’t just tell me exactly how to do it, which happened at one point last lesson. This will depthen my understanding the most effective way of coding using python.</td>
