    <td>The last time I had entered an IT lesson was just over three months, so it was inevitable that my coding and computational thinking skills were quite rusty. Thankfully,, my mind was quickly refreshed from yet another engaging lesson with Mr Keen, where we weren't just mindlessly tapping the keyboard of a computer. We were briefed on basic coding skills on python and reminded how the whole planet could be deeply helped by practising some computational thinking. I completed the homework very effectively, thinking logically and using my own knowledge to complete the work efficiently.     </td>

    <td>If I’m going to be honest, I would be lying straight at your face if I said I was buzzing and couldn’t stop looking forward to my next IT lesson throughout my three month break, and this affected how I listened to my teacher’s lecture this week, and I did drift off into daydreaming a few times in the lesson. However, I did get the gist of what he was talking about and understood the coding side of things, and realised my IT lessons weren’t going to be as bad as I imagined.</td>

    <td>Next time I will make sure I enter my IT lesson in a more optimistic mood and try to be eager to learn. I will also try and be more engaged in the lesson and depthen my learning further, to enhance my computationall thinking skills.</td>
