    <td>In the lesson I didn't achieve much - I spent too much time experimenting with different colour schemes in my blog resulting in me inevitably using the one I was going to use originally. In addition my changes kept on failing, as did everyone else’s which hastily got very irritating, especially for someone like me whose patience stretches about as far as the size of a paperclip. However I didn’t get frustrated with the work itself and my problem solving was effective enough to help me to complete the tasks I needed to complete. At home I decided to make further improvements on my blog and do something constructive for once, and managed to change my table and take away my margin, which I prefered the look of. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I probably didn’t work hard enough in the lesson - I could’ve completed more changes and looked for inspiration from different classmates, despite the fact that I probably would’ve had an irrelevant conversation about what happened on The Apprentice last night. I should’ve extended myself some more, even at home - I could’ve tried some new stuff by looking at youtube videos and getting advice from my peers; I could always do with some different viewpoints.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will challenge myself a lot more and make sure I have a slightly more ambitious target and that I’m more motivated to achieve it - I could potentially set myself a reward if I fulfill my target. I will also view different blogs on the internet and teach myself, with the help of the internet, to learn different techniques. I will also ask for some proper advice - I asked my teacher to help me once and it was to find out how to change the font of my blog, which I now realise was quite naive of me and only required a bit more thinking to work out. I could’ve asked used my time with him more constructively. Overall, I have the potential to do well but I should just spend more time on it.</td>
