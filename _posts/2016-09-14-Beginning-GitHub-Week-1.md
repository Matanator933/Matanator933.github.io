  <tr>
    <td>I was not even close to completing the task target even with homework time, and have still not got any idea on how to go about this task even after asking multiple people. My learning was extremely ineffective and hindered by my lack of computing ability.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited by my incompetence in this project, as i was behind even when we were signing up and forking Jekyll. I have no idea whatsoever about what to do in the lesson and still don't even after homework.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will improve next time by keeping up with the class learning and not getting distracted and not being afraid about asking for help. </td>
