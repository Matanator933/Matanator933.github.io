    <td>It took me a long time to achieve creating the table. For some reason after I had tried many times there were still no tables in my blog. After asking for advice from my classmates I finally copied out the code character for character and then it had finally worked.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I got very frustrated at my work and I wasn't creative enough and probably spent more time than I should’ve trying to solve the problem. In addition, I had to rely on someone else’s code in order to get a table, when preferably I would’ve liked to be able to complete the task independently.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will copy code from my other classmates which code had been successful and I will prevent myself from being frustrated. I will also not seize to try new resolutions in order to fix my problems instead of constantly trying the same thing.</td>
